Do you dream of software that can adapt, learn, and collaborate? Imagine a world where your applications are composed of intelligent, independent \"agents\" working together seamlessly. This isn't science fiction; it's the reality of multi-agent systems (MAS), and it's about to revolutionize how you build software.\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of MAS is **enhanced modularity and maintainability**. By breaking down complex problems into smaller, self-contained agent-sized units, you make your system inherently more manageable. This allows for independent development and testing of individual agents, drastically speeding up the development lifecycle and reducing the risk of cascading failures. Need to update a feature? With MAS, modifying a single agent has minimal impact on the rest of the system, making software evolution and maintenance far more agile.\n\nBeyond maintainability, MAS offers **increased robustness and resilience**. The distributed nature of these systems means that the failure of one agent doesn't necessarily bring down the entire application, leading to higher availability. Agents can even be designed for self-healing and recovery, detecting issues in others and taking over responsibilities. This adaptability allows your software to dynamically adjust its behavior in response to unforeseen circumstances or environmental shifts.\n\nFinally, MAS unlock **powerful problem-solving capabilities**. Agents can possess specialized knowledge and reasoning, tackling complex issues collaboratively. The inherent concurrency and parallelism in MAS lead to faster execution and better resource utilization. Perhaps most exciting is the potential for emergent behavior – complex, intelligent solutions can arise from the interactions of simple agents, solving problems that might be difficult to design explicitly.\n\nEmbracing multi-agent systems isn't just adopting a new architectural pattern; it's unlocking a new paradigm.

For twenty years, the Saltmarsh Lighthouse had been his world, a solitary sentinel against the unforgiving sea. Tonight, however, a different kind of light caught his eye. Tucked beneath a loose floorboard in his cramped quarters lay a rolled parchment, its edges singed. As he unfurled it, a soft, ethereal glow emanated from the intricate lines and symbols. It wasn't ink, but something alive, pulsing with a faint warmth. The map depicted not coastlines, but currents of light, swirling and intersecting in an alien configuration. A single, pulsing star marked a location far beyond any known horizon. Elias, a man who’d charted every wave and tide, felt a thrill of the unknown ignite within him. The sea had just revealed a new, extraordinary depth.\nCriticAgent > The plot is intriguing, setting up a compelling mystery. Elias is a well-established character through his routine and isolation, and the introduction of the map immediately sparks his curiosity. However, the pacing feels a little rushed in the latter half. The story introduces a major fantastical element and then ends abruptly, leaving the reader wanting more.\n\nHere are 2-3 specific, actionable suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Expand on Elias's reaction and initial investigation:** Instead of immediately feeling a \"thrill of the unknown,\" show Elias’s initial confusion, disbelief, or even fear. Describe him examining the parchment more closely, perhaps trying to decipher the symbols or understand the \"currents of light.\" This will make his eventual acceptance and excitement more earned.\n2.  **Introduce a hint of conflict or consequence:** The map represents a significant shift in Elias's world. What does this discovery *mean* for him? Does it promise adventure, danger, or a new purpose? Hinting at a potential challenge or the personal cost of following this map could add immediate stakes and further deepen the narrative. For example, he might recall old sea legends or feel a pang of regret for leaving his predictable life.\n3.  **Consider a brief foreshadowing of the map's origin or purpose:** While the mystery is good, a very subtle clue about *why* this map exists or *who* might have left it could enhance the intrigue without giving too much away. Perhaps the singed edges suggest a powerful event, or a symbol on the map reminds him of something he's only heard about in hushed whispers.\nRefinerAgent > Elias polished the brass railing until it gleamed, the rhythmic rasp of cloth a familiar lullaby. For twenty years, the Saltmarsh Lighthouse had been his world, a solitary sentinel against the unforgiving sea. His life was a predictable tide of oiling machinery, trimming wicks, and scanning the horizon. Tonight, however, the familiar solitude was broken by an anomaly. Tucked beneath a loose floorboard in his cramped quarters lay a rolled parchment, its edges strangely brittle, as if kissed by an ancient flame.\n\nWith a sigh, Elias unfurled it, expecting perhaps a forgotten logbook entry or a sailor's crude drawing. Instead, a soft, ethereal glow bloomed from the parchment, illuminating his weathered face. It wasn't ink, but something alive, pulsing with a faint warmth that sent a shiver, not entirely unpleasant, up his arm. The map depicted not coastlines or known constellations, but intricate currents of light, swirling and intersecting in an alien configuration. His brow furrowed. These weren't currents he recognized from any chart or sea lore. They pulsed with an energy that felt both ancient and new. A single, brilliant star, brighter than any celestial body he knew, marked a location far beyond any charted horizon.\n\nDisbelief warred with a dawning sense of wonder. Elias, a man who’d spent two decades charting every wave and tide of his known world, traced the luminous lines with a hesitant finger. He tried to decipher the symbols, which seemed to writhe and shift as he looked at them, hinting at a language not meant for human tongues. The singed edges of the parchment seemed to whisper of a powerful, perhaps catastrophic, event. Was this a map to a place of myth, or a warning? He recalled hushed tales from his youth, sailors speaking of phantom lights and seas that swallowed ships whole, legends he’d always dismissed as fancy. Now, staring at this impossible map, a prickle of fear mingled with an undeniable, burgeoning excitement. This discovery promised not just adventure, but a profound shift, a potential departure from the quiet predictability he’d always known. Leaving this lonely tower for the unknown would mean abandoning the only life he’d ever had, a thought that now felt both terrifying and strangely liberating. The sea, his constant companion and adversary, had just revealed a new, extraordinary, and potentially perilous depth.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.

You're Now an Agent Orchestrator\n\nIn this notebook, you made the leap from a single agent to a **multi-agent system**.\n\nYou saw **why** a team of specialists is easier to build and debug than one \"do-it-all\" agent. Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n\nYou used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions. You also mastered the \"plumbing\" by using `output_key` to pass state between agents and make them collaborative.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.
